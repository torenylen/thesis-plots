# Suno and Udio vocal population plots

This repo allows you to interact with the plots I created for my thesis project. You can download the web folder and run it locally with `python -m http.server`, or just visit [the GitHub page](https://torenylen.github.io/thesis-plots/web/).

You will need to download and load a csv file, which you can grab from the csv folder of this repo.

You might want add a link to all the processed vocals if you run this locally, so you can play the songs directly in the plot. If you can't bother with that you can click the Suno or Udio links to find the full songs there.

If you want more details, read my thesis.
